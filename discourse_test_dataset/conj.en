As of now, of course, I didn't want to say anything. _eos Since you advised me not to talk except in your presence.
One of the two officers here recalled the previous prowler call and brought it to my attention. _eos Since there had been a prowler around the house before, it would perhaps be quite natural for your husband to be alarmed by the second one, wouldn't it?
