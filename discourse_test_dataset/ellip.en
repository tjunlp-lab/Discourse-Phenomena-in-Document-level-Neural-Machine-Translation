You have money for taxi, right? _eos I do.
When'd you learn how to swim? _eos I didn't learn.
You're introverted, I see. _eos I didn't think so.
I don't eat eaten food. _eos But Eunchae does.
Yesterday, who brought me home? _eos Dad did.
Why don't you get off of me and go. _eos Don't want to.
Where did that lady say it is? _eos I don't know either.
How do I know the bus number going to Maljookuri? _eos I don't know!
Give the signal: join us! _eos Join!
Get to work! _eos We quit!
As long as she doesn't get wise that you're giving the runaround with every dame in the coop. _eos When she does, I'll get me a new mama, peaches.
But I remember she was wonderful. _eos I'll say so.
I don't want to go back to the hotel with Hitch. _eos Please, mommy, please.
But you got no idea how tough it is to be all alone and lonesome in a city like this. _eos Maybe I have.
Oh, no, I think Tony's a nice name. _eos You do?
Did April come in yet? _eos She didn't?
I got a week to make up my mind if I'm gonna enlist again. _eos I suppose I will.
Aren't there a lot of people in the world, though? _eos Only two as far as I'm concerned.
I'd hate to fall. _eos If you did, I'd fall right after you.
Oh, I thought for a minute you were serious. _eos I am.
I decided it. _eos Did you?
I don't see why. _eos Because if you don't, I'll jump right off this roof.
Aw, gee, I'm happy. _eos Aren't you?
Mommy, you look tired. _eos I am a little.
I've nothing to fear. _eos Not you, maybe, but we do!
I was doing my duty. _eos As you always do.
You see, she doesn't know. _eos Neither do I.
Shall we take a walk? _eos Yes, let's.
You'll never get married. _eos We will!
I hate to leave our fine house. _eos So do I.
The Saxonia company will never sign... unless your firm is tied up with the Manchester people. _eos They don't have to.
When I came here to live, did I ask you for a cheap room? _eos Did I?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? _eos I have, indeed.
Last night there was no applause. _eos There was.
Why, we did not take the initiative! _eos You did.
Don't you understand? _eos Don't you?
Do you want to make a man happy? _eos I'd love to.
You loved the Baron, didn't you? _eos So did I.
You don't understand that, do you? _eos Yes, I do.
After what happened, you need rest badly. _eos But I don't.
Madame, I don't believe in making plans. _eos Neither do I, monsieur.
Uh, I don't think that Martel girl is so attractive. _eos I do.
Why should I drag along a third person? _eos Isn't it?
Says she feels like as if it's the end of everything. _eos Oh, so do I.
Oh, how wonderful our marriage has been. _eos "Has"?
Well, I never seen her. _eos I have.
I've never been to Oxford. _eos But my husband has.
I didn't know he had a cycle. _eos He hasn't anymore.
This complete loveliness will fade, and we shall forget what it was like. _eos Edith, don't.
He wants a drink. _eos So do I.
I thought it was all going to finish before I was old enough to go out. _eos So did I, once.
I don't know what you mean. _eos Oh, yes, you do.
And you don't want to broach it. _eos Then don't.
Maybe I want to be a hooligan. _eos No, you don't.
I guess he knows now, how I feel about his job. _eos I bet he does, too.
These seats accommodate two people, don't they? _eos Maybe they do, maybe they don't.
I didn't ask for your advice. _eos That's right, you didn't.
Spoiled people are used to having their way. _eos I never have.
You love them, don't you? _eos Yes, I do.
I don't like you. _eos Never will.
Would you like him to be better looking than all men, tall and gracious? _eos - Yes, I think I would.
Your husband doesn't mean a thing to you. _eos He does.
You're in love with His Excellency, Count Alexei, aren't you? _eos No, Your Majesty, I'm not.
If you're the grand duchess, then I'm the grand duke. _eos I wish you were!
You don't believe me? _eos Frankly, I don't.
Come again another time. _eos Good-bye, we'd love to.
The judge get a salary? _eos Sure, he does.
Listen, I'm not taking any orders from Johnny Ramirez. _eos I am!
Dale, you... you're swell. _eos Of course I am.
And we're going to have lots of fun together. _eos Are we?
You don't believe me, do you, Johnny? _eos No, I don't.
Either you want to buy the La Rueda, _eos Or you don't.
Don't hit any foul balls. _eos I'll try not to.
I'm awfully sorry. _eos You should be.
I said I wouldn't give you one. _eos But you have.
Now, I've taken an awful lot from you since I've been here and you're the last man I'd ask anything of unless it meant a great deal to me. _eos The service does.
But don't tell him I said so. _eos Don't worry, I won't.
They've got a great hideout, wherever it is. _eos I'll say they have.
I thought you said McKay quit. _eos I did, but.
You don't look very glad about it. _eos Oh, I am, Brad.
Didn't you know? _eos - No, I didn't.
Have you seen Jones? _eos No, I haven't.
I hope he don't lose his job. _eos I hope he does!
Whenever I run across a funny name, I like to find a rhyme. _eos Don't you?
We own an opera house, don't we? _eos We do.
Will you promise me to be careful from now on? _eos Yes, I guess I'll have to.
If I lived in New York, I'd go every day. _eos I bet you do.
You don't go out with girls very much. _eos I haven't.
Do you know what that is? _eos Of course you don't.
Have you finished your book? _eos I have.
Have you got visitors? _eos You see we have.
He told us to scatter the type of your book. _eos He did?
I like this place best of all the spots I've been to. _eos You do?
She always hides important things in the top drawer of her dresser. _eos She does?
They spoke very well of you, and they said you were a real gentleman. _eos Oh, did they really?
There was a woman there, if I hadn't been a lady I would have slapped her face. _eos Why didn't you?
Of course it's silly. _eos And so are you.
You'd be surprised what I'd give to get an earful of that. _eos You would.
Could you sort of see that he gets it? _eos I should say so.
A mere mention of his name and I feel positively murderous. _eos You do?
Maybe they're wearing them that way this year. _eos Well, I'm not.
And then you offered a toast, you remember? _eos No, I don't.
Isn't that funny, I knew you were going to ask me that. _eos So did I.
I'm afraid that my sister has a somewhat distorted sense of humor. _eos So have I.
Have you folks been drinking? _eos No, I haven't.
That is, if you've nothing else to do. _eos No, I don't.
Please don't send me away! _eos If you do, she'll kill me.
The little men are not here? _eos No, they're not.
You know, we Saxons aren't gonna put up with these oppressions much longer. _eos Oh, you're not?
Come. _eos I'll not.
I said I'm not hungry. _eos Why, so you did.
And you do intend to warn him, don't you? _eos Don't you?
You got it all in your stupid head now? _eos Of course I have.
Of course she's still on the train, I know that. _eos Nobody said she isn't.
Do you happen to remember seeing this young lady pass the compartment with a little Englishwoman? _eos I'm afraid not.
Would you like to hear about my early life? _eos I don't think so.
Well, people just don't vanish and so forth. _eos She has.
I told you that hours ago. _eos Oh, yes, so you did.
Don't you think it's rather peculiar that she's wearing high-heeled shoes? _eos Oh, is she?
Do you have a good memory for numbers? _eos I do.
You've never been caught in a similar situation? _eos Yes, I have.
Did you make any change in this room? _eos I don't think so.
I told you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you. _eos Yes, you did.
Here is my egg. _eos And here is mine.
He won't come back! _eos Last time he did!
Last time he did! _eos This time he won't.
I was afraid you wouldn't come. _eos Tonight would've been ruined if you hadn't.
She hasn't harmed you. _eos You have.
That was natural under the circumstances, but he needs you now. _eos He does.
Is it necessary? _eos It is to me.
I happen to know she's with her aunt in Harpenden. _eos I'm afraid she isn't.
I don't care if I ever see him again. _eos You won't have to.
They have asked me to get you to tell me what they are trying to find out. _eos But I can't do that.
Because you're English, half English, anyway. _eos I'm not.
Go ahead, but keep moving. _eos We aim to.
Didn't none of these have no breakfast? _eos Me and my brother did.
I got work, if you want to take it, okay. _eos If not, just sit here, that's all.
Do you believe in God? _eos I do.
Have them shot. _eos They were.
Somebody made a fool of us. _eos I did.
If you have to, you have to. _eos He had to.
Didn't you tell him? _eos No, she didn't.
He'll say the same as the rest. _eos Suppose he does.
I'm independent too, you know. _eos I know you are.
Don't you think that Hildy's entitled to spend her remaining years without worries of money? _eos Of course you do, Bruce.
And so into this little tortured mind came the idea that that gun had been produced for use. _eos And use it he did.
You don't want to come with me, do you? _eos Answer me, you don't, do you?
I'm not going back. _eos The ship is.
You don't know what I mean. _eos Indeed, indeed I do.
Don't you realize what this means? _eos Yes, I do.
I'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that, about a wish coming true, do you? _eos Well, I didn't either.
I fell down. _eos Oh, you did.
I want to go to the inquest with you. _eos I'd rather you didn't, darling.
There's something you don't know. _eos Oh, no, there isn't.
I said I'd be here, baby. _eos Yes, so you did.
You better start thinking, Moll, or else I'm going to slug you. _eos And if I do, they'll slap us into solitary together.
You aren't afraid, are you? _eos Maybe I am.
Not if it came from you, Verne, because you couldn't say it. _eos But suppose I did?
Anyway, I'm not going to worry about it. _eos But you are.
Have you seen her yet? _eos No, have you?
He has a wife and three children in England. _eos Yes, they usually do, though not always in England.
I don't know where the bird is, and neither do you. _eos She does.
She didn't tell you what it is? _eos Cairo didn't, either?
Cairo didn't say he know, and he didn't say he didn't. _eos She said she didn't.
Then you didn't try to make a deal with him before giving him the works? _eos We most certainly did.
By gad, I believe you would. _eos I really do.
You know whether you love me or not. _eos Maybe I do.
Don't give any to Tom, all right? _eos Never do that.
Didn't you tell us to stay out? _eos Yes, I did.
Why don't they live with you? _eos Have been.
Children should be ind and warm to their mother. _eos But you haven't.
Let me handle it. _eos So do as I say.
 Have a drink? _eos You mind if I do?
Who told you to ask me that? _eos He did.
When I was in the concentration camp were you lonely in Paris? _eos Yes, Victor, I was.
Get them for me. _eos I don't have to.
You don't know what you're talking about. _eos Yes, I do.
She was in a fire and lost her clothes. _eos No, I didn't.
Let's stop, Wally. _eos I guess we'll have to.
I don't know how to begin. _eos Then don't.
I knew it all the time. _eos You did?
You mean a mock marriage? _eos I certainly do not.
Well, young man, I don't know what you're talking about. _eos I think maybe you do!
But they said this man is really dangerous. _eos I'm sure they did.
Now you see it. _eos Now you don't.
I don't know what he'll think when he sees me with four other fellas. _eos I don't either.
He has to go to college, doesn't he? _eos Who does?
You still want that stuff from Gates? _eos Of course I do.
He doesn't like him now, does he? _eos No, he doesn't.
I afraid? _eos Why should I be?
Who made you up? _eos I did, Mr. Dobosh.
But I love my husband. _eos No, you don't.
I know you will be delighted to see the Führer again. _eos Who wouldn't?
I thought you were wearing a mustache. _eos I am.
Why didn't you tell me? _eos How could I?
I didn't know they were in love. _eos They're not.
You blow trains? _eos I have.
I saw nothing. _eos Yes, you did.
Who knows the way through to the Republicans? _eos I do.
I've thought of a way to explode the dynamite. _eos So have I.
Don't cry. _eos No, I don't.
Ask him if he speaks English. _eos He says no.
You didn't even look at it. _eos I don't have to.
Roger doesn't mind. _eos No, certainly not.
Ann says you want to speak to me. _eos Saunders wants to.
As a matter of fact, I thought he'd be here this afternoon. _eos But he's not?
You want me to go? _eos If you want to.
Don't you even remember that? _eos Yes, of course I do.
Never go out anywhere. _eos At least, she doesn't.
I didn't know, Gregory. _eos I didn't.
I agree with Stanley. _eos So do I.
You don't understand. _eos Sure, I do!
Did he ask you the time? _eos Of course he did.
You would like some supper, I expect. _eos Yes, I should.
I really don't know what to say. _eos Neither do I.
You need a good night's rest. _eos So does Bogardus.
You have to pass your examinations. _eos But I could have.
I haven't asked her. _eos You should.
I swear to you that during the séance I was convinced I heard Elvira's voice. _eos Nobody else did. 
The cops don't pay you any money. _eos And I do.
It's hard to believe she could have done it. _eos I know she didn't.
Did she tell you that I met him first? _eos No, I don't think she did.
It's not an easy thing to tell you. _eos But I feel I should.
He doesn't want to speak to George. _eos He does so.
Sit down, you're still tight. _eos I don't want to.
Doesn't your present wife ever object? _eos She does not.
Christine told you. _eos She shouldn't have.
Did you ever see that woman around here? _eos No, I don't think I have.
Maybe we can even make the police believe she did it. _eos They might not.
I'm going out of here and she's coming with me. _eos You may be, Marty, but not the girl.
You know, I don't know why I bothered to tell you. _eos I don't either.
Have you finished? _eos I don't want to.
Want me to set it up? _eos No, I'll do it.
You understand, don't you? _eos You do, don't you?
Give him back his ring. _eos I won't.
How did you know I was going to ask you out to dinner? _eos I didn't.
I don't think I ever heard it before. _eos You should have.
He doesn't hear me. _eos He does.
You didn't tell me about that, too. _eos I should have.
Don't you see? _eos You don't, do you?
I know where river is. _eos So do I.
Ernie knows who dragged Adams out of here. _eos So do I.
You're looking well, Miriam. _eos So are you.
Did you find a feature to write about yet? _eos I haven't, and I don't intend to.
I don't pretend to know what goes on behind that pretty little face of yours. _eos I don't want to.
Do you want to marry me? _eos I do.
Today I'm gonna die. _eos And so will she.
But he will find out. _eos And when he does, he will follow.
Blackmail is the simplest of crimes when we have the cooperation of the victim. _eos Almost impossible when we haven't.
Hey, brother _eos Call me Officer Lam while working not brother.
Do you think there is a chance that Frank will get free? _eos Do you want him to?
Then I will follow it. _eos Do not, my lord.
Is it not possible to understand in another tongue? _eos You'll do better, sir.
Whether I want them or not, I have a right to know. _eos Yeah, I guess you do at that.
I think it's really perfect. _eos All my friends do too.
Jefty, we know each other too well. _eos Do we?
Somehow, I don't think she's going to succeed. _eos Do you?
You know, there's nothing wrong with your dancing. _eos Do you do a lot of it?
I hope they get you tonight. _eos Yeah, I hope they do for me!
I don't know, do you? _eos No.
You will go, won't you? _eos Do it for me.
I have to make a call. _eos It is a connection that I can't do from home.
How did you know I was going to ask you out to dinner? _eos I didn't.
I wish I knew what that meant. _eos If I did, I'd tell you.
I see your point. _eos Do you?
Don't you see? _eos You don't, do you?
I know where river is. _eos So do I.
Ernie knows who dragged Adams out of here. _eos So do I.
I thought you enjoyed driving that horrible little jet-propelled torpedo. _eos Well, I do but you don't.
You expect me to ask the usual favor. _eos Do I?
She's decided she wants to have my child. _eos Let her do it.
Do you know anything about them? _eos No, I don't, ma'am.
Mother thought he ought to be home with her. _eos Well, so do I.
You never study anyway. _eos I do too.
What a murderous thug I look. _eos Yes, you do rather.
Mrs Phillips, tell me if you see a little light. _eos Do you?
Joyce, I don't need any sleep. _eos Oh, yes, I do too.
Yes, I know how you feel. _eos Do you?
Remember? _eos Do you?
Do you understand that? _eos Do you?
Do you pray, Henry? _eos But do you now?
She'd be mad, maybe throw an ashtray. _eos Just that?
I know. _eos Do you?
I want to dance with Tracy. _eos Do you, Uncle Willie?
Let's just concentrate on winning the case. _eos If we can do that, then the rest will take care of itself.
If you know, say so. _eos If you do not, say so.
You don't believe in witchcraft? _eos Do you?
You really want to kiss me, don't you? _eos Boy, do I.
I understand. _eos Do you really?
Yes, but first I have to kill him. _eos Yes, do that.
You do believe me, don't you? _eos I do now.
Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent? _eos Do you?
I like. _eos And so do you.
Do you know what is 4 x 7? _eos I do, but do you?
I can't understand how I did that. _eos Neither do I.
I like to walk in the rain. _eos I do to.
I don't know. _eos Neither do I.
I don't know. _eos Then neither do I.
She didn't see them. _eos I did.
All you have to do is pick up the telephone! _eos And do what?
You said you didn't believe. _eos I don't, but you do.
Do you write to each other frequently? _eos Yes, so do our wives.
M thinks I'm wasting my time here. _eos And so do I.
The third time, he will succeed unless I get him first. _eos That I'll do tonight.
I gotta get myself a job. _eos What do you mean, a job?
I wanted to take a bath, too. _eos You go first.
Well, don't just sit there, damn it, bail. _eos Do as I say.
You know him better though. _eos - I do not.
I love you, do you know that? _eos You don't, do you?
You don't even know the girl's name. _eos Or do you?
Here's a dance. _eos You can do on a dime.
Because I need that shoulder to lean on. _eos Yes, I really do.
Do you believe that? _eos Do you?
Do I like the war? _eos Good God, no.
You don't ask if I love him. _eos Do you?
What I don't understand is why. _eos Neither do I.
I love you. _eos As I do you.
But I don't know what to say. _eos Yes, you do.
Why don't you believe me? _eos I do.
He knows how to fight. _eos So do I.
Hey, you want to buy a painting or not? _eos Do you?
I don't understand. _eos No, I do.
If you don't like it, write it yourself. _eos I'll do that!
I'll go and pack. _eos Maybe I should do it.
Do you even trust your own wife? _eos Do you?
Don't you know? _eos Do you?
I said take off your boots and show me. _eos I ain't gonna do that.
Won't you mind being so far away from your boy? _eos Of course, I will.
Yeah, you know what they say about rabbits. _eos No.
Do you trust me? _eos Yes, and I'm happy to do.
We gotta get rid of that guy. _eos Just how are you gonna do that, Lewis?
Do you like the idea? _eos Do I ever!
Excuse me, ma'am, do you remember the Deluge? _eos Do I ever!
Well, do you know something that I don't know? _eos Maybe I do and maybe I don't.
You want to start looking for a job now? _eos Well, neither do I.
I think I know what he means. _eos I think I do too.
You gonna be able to get to school on your own, are you then? _eos I do it every day.
I don't even know who you are. _eos Neither do I.
You don't like cameraman, is that it's? _eos I do really, I mean it.
You love a jerk? _eos Yes, I do.
you know Tom? _eos I should I do.
I don't understand. _eos Neither do we.
I do care. _eos You do not.
Won't you ask me to sit down? _eos No, you'd do it.
You forget that we have not yet examined Pennington's cabin. _eos Let's do it now.
A monk should not kill. _eos A monk cannot.
Now, eat it. _eos Now do it!
Do you know what the man's saying? _eos Do you?
Oh, I love to be frightened. _eos Do you?
She's supposed to take me to school. _eos She told me to do it.
Shall we go see the barn? _eos Better do so.
That's what you should worry about. _eos Do that.
I cheated on you but you don't know. _eos Yes, I do.
Do you understand? _eos Do you?
I'm not sure that I understand. _eos I'm not sure that I do either, sir.
But I don't know anything! _eos Neither do we!
I don't know, but I'm going to find out. _eos You do that.
You'll never get Helge to agree. _eos So the rest of us can do it.
I want to know what's going on here. _eos So do I.
He watches you for his own amusement. _eos As I do you, Madam.
Mr. Herbert, one way or another stands to benefit by Mr. Neville's industry. _eos As do we all.
Tell me do you think about hell? _eos No, neither do I.
To look for her. _eos How will you do that?
Do you dare? _eos If you do, I do so too
Legendre demands that the accused be allowed to take the stand. _eos We all do.
I know who did it. _eos So do I.
Would you keep an eye on her? _eos I do already.
You don't believe people can kill themselves for love? _eos Would you do it, if I left you?
Why didn't you tell me? _eos Because It has nothing to do with it.
I'll make the bed. _eos I'll do it myself.
I have to pick it up. _eos Let me do it.
Doctor, please take a seat. _eos I shall do nothing of the kind.
Time enough for me to fall asleep and find him. _eos Honey, you just do that.
You want to throw a glass? _eos I can do that too.
Eat. _eos Yes, we must do that.
You've got to write me a letter to Paula. _eos Have Tony do it.
I like to comb your hair. _eos Yeah, but I'm old enough to do it.
I'll punish him. _eos Okay, you do it for me.
Guards, take him out and behead him. _eos Do it if you can.
Could I have your signature? _eos Sure, what do you got?
We understand, Dorothy. _eos Do you?
I don't believe in this world sorrow, do you? _eos No, I don't.
I don't know! _eos Neither do I!
He doesn't want her to come back. _eos And neither do I.
The first thing I need is to get into her apartment and open a window that I can crawl into later. _eos How are you gonna do that?
Open the window. _eos I'll do it.
Miss Daly will carve the ham. _eos And I'll do the pudding.
I don't believe in curses. _eos Neither do I.
I know what they're going through. _eos So do I.
I had my reasons! _eos So do we.
And taught her gesticulation _eos Can a blind person do that?
Do you know who you are? _eos Do you?
Um, it might be a good idea to make up the spare bedroom just in case. _eos Sí, Mrs. Holly, I do that already.
I love you. _eos So do a lot of the other guys.
You don't think. _eos Do you?
I need luck. _eos So do I!
Do you hear this? _eos I do now.
Push him in. _eos Do it!
I don't know how to dance to this music. _eos Neither do I.
Then you can hit her in my presence. _eos Do it for me!
