# Abstract:
The need to evaluate the ability of context aware neural machine translation (NMT) models in dealing with specific discourse phenomena arises in document-level NMT. However, test sets that satisfy this need are rare. In this paper, we propose a test suite to evaluate three common discourse phenomena in English-Chinese translation: pronoun, discourse connective and ellipsis where discourse
divergences lie across the two languages. The
test suite contains 1,200 instances, 400 for
each type of discourse phenomena. We perform both automatic and human evaluation with three state-of-the-art context-aware NMT models on the proposed test suite. Results suggest that our test suite can be used as a challenging benchmark test bed for evaluating document-level NMT.
